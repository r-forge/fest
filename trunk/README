The R package FEST 
requires the following freeware to be installed and path variables to be set:
    *   Merlin (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/merlin/index.html)
    *   Perl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/)
To set the path variables in Windows, right-click “My Computer”, select
Properties>Advanced>Environment Variables, and add the locations of Merlin and Perl to the
variable named Path.
